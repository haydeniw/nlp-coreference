# NLP Coreference Resolution
This project produces more detailed permutations of sentences with vague references. 

## Description

This project uses the [AllenNLP coreference resolution model](https://demo.allennlp.org/coreference-resolution). It takes a sentence with
broad references such as "it", "he", "she", "they" and rebuilds the sentence
with all possible coreference permutations as identified by the model. 
Ultimately, it is designed to be hosted on a web server for more general usage.
